# Lab: Publishing and subscribing to Event Grid events

## Lab scenario

Your company builds a human resources (HR) system used by various customers around the world. While the system works fine today, your development managers have decided to begin re-architecting the solution by decoupling application components. This decision was driven by a desire to make any future development simpler through modularity. As the developer who manages component communication, you have decided to introduce Microsoft Azure Event Grid as your solution-wide messaging platform.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

-   Create an Event Grid topic.

-   Use the Azure Event Grid viewer to subscribe to a topic and illustrate published messages.

-   Publish a message from a .NET application.
